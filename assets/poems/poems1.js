    happyPeople = `
    From where I stand </br>
    Beneath the sky’s southeastern sun and water-tower, </br>
    Inline with a few riddles of time </br>
    Before travel was banned, and </br>
    Outlaws roaming dirty-wild in masks and spurs </br>
    With gallant horses fierce in battle </br>
    Protecting monolithic foundations at the Temple of Jupiter </br>
    To praise Athena and the much older sun deity Shamash, </br>
    Lived a tribe, in the deserts of now Idaho. </br>
    Happy people, doing their best to survive. </br>
    `

    valiantAndOtherwise = `
    There will be a tomorrow </br>
    Until our consciousness </br>
    Melts into flowers, and mud </br>
    Cascading down a river with </br>
    Red-brown canyon walls and birds circling to land </br>
    Before night scares them from the sky. </br>
    Did he want a watery grave </br>
    When twisting currents took his final breath, or </br>
    Was it his reward for so many efforts, </br>
    Valiant and otherwise? </br>
    Tonight we danced to the music and silence </br>
    Me, and all my other selves </br>
    Laughing, at the wonder of it all, </br>
    My soul glowing </br>
    Brighter than distant stars in the dark.
    `

    asteroidsOrbit = `
    There’s gravel in my gut </br>
    Aseity is my form </br>
    Asteroids orbit my Angkor Wat voice </br>
    Fortify, multiply, resupply... </br>
    Demystify the horrible events that await us </br>
    As diversion from the truth— </br>
    Powerful financial terrorists </br>
    Undermine capitalism, our freedoms </br>
    In their ravenous lust for power </br>
    They print endless amounts of money. </br>
    What if the world is not as they describe? </br>
    Younger Dryas caused our social amnesia </br>
    From those that lived before us. </br>
    Bitcoin provides hope for a better future! </br>
    This scarce and beautiful digital money </br>
    Removes the root source of their despotic power— </br>
    The ability for a [not] trusted few to control the money supply. </br>
    A just society requires not using fiat fake money! </br>
    End the madness of vile centralized banking— </br>
    Fewer bombs will drop from the sky.
    `

    dancingSilently = `
    Sitting beside the black diagonals of the rubber doormat </br>
    Is a pair of Chaco's in the dirt </br>
    The sandal straps, green and blue, rigid in place </br>
    Waiting patiently for the next step </br>
    Down a well-maintained USFS gravel road, around </br>
    Twenty meters from where I'm parked, camping </br>
    Alone, except for the varied calls of passing birds, and </br>
    In the distance, a fire lookout tower, whose attendant, I hope </br>
    Greatly appreciates the hospitality of their view. </br>
    I'm on an adventure to the Malhuer National Forest </br>
    To escape the low elevations of August, to isolate </br>
    And to read, observe, consider, and reflect— </br>
    Some of which are things a chess player ought to do before every move. </br>
    It's been a peaceful experience, living </br>
    In this pine-scented Central Oregon mountain air </br>
    And I have enjoyed a feeling that everything is okay, will be okay... </br>
    The pastel horizon dancing silently into the evening dark.</br>
    `

    memoriesOfAnotherTime = `
    Here are the desert grasses </br>
    Waving easterly in the Wyoming high-plateau breeze </br>
    Mid-summer snow-packed Teton peaks carving half the horizon </br>
    Light flashing gold purple wildflowers </br>
    And perfectly healthy colored sage. </br>
    It's Warren Bridge freedom at the Green River stream— </br>
    Fisherman, rafting, antelope grazing </br>
    Borges poetry, metaphysics, Java server-side logic </br>
    Paneer tikka masala, almonds, plenty of water </br>
    And importantly, no distractions from iPhone bombardment. </br>
    Along with Isidoro Suárez </br>
    We will all someday be desert dust, </br>
    And glory— </br>
    Memories of another time. </br>
    I choose to be present here now </br>
    Alone in this serene, peaceful desert. </br>
    Hello to the world, and </br>
    Thank you for today.
    `

    nationalEmpire = `
    Hungry and afraid they soldiered onward </br>
    Finding peace in the simplest of things— </br>
    A cumulus picture in the expansive blue afternoon sky, <br />
    The greening yard of an early Idaho spring, <br />
    Flowers, so beautiful, vivid, and real. <br />
    Heroically they survived the dying days <br />
    Of the greatest national empire of debt <br />
    The multiverse could create, yet <br />
    The vicious cycle would start anew, as <br />
    The banking cartel strictly enforced <br />
    The use of their new global money, <br />
    Mayer Anselm Rothschild’s ancestor <br />
    Repeating from his island pink palace <br />
    That he who controls the money supply <br />
    Cares not who makes the laws.`

    sansAnesthesia = `
    With god-like furry, and <br />
    The temperament of a rogue wave, <br />
    He steeled himself against the others. <br />
    How dare they be unaware <br />
    Of the devilish plot <br />
    To marginalize, separate, and shear. <br />
    Fear and worry strangled dissents, <br />
    Almost all became witting accomplices <br />
    To their own confinements, yet <br />
    The virulent debasements did sneak past them <br />
    In the night of hundred year scheme, <br />
    Bankers and politicians dissected them <br />
    Sans anesthesia. <br />
    Most were pleased for the scraps <br />
    Tossed to them from under the table, <br />
    He was not. <br />
    He chose to stand with Julian, <br />
    As truth will break their spines.`

    misstepsOfGoodIntentions = `
    From missteps of good intentions <br />
    The wanderer became unwelcome <br />
    In his trek through gray-brown desert. <br />
    Sagebrush began to whistle insults as he walked, <br />
    The wind was unrelenting, gritty, oppressive, <br />
    And a cold spring rainstorm pelted his face, <br />
    Wearing him out, <br />
    Weighing him down, <br />
    Chafing his every step. <br />
    Eventually he stumbled on a downslope, and fell, <br />
    Landing hard upon a crooked rock, <br />
    Injured and unsure. <br />
    After a moment of uncertainty <br />
    He stood, <br />
    Tall and fierce, <br />
    Knowing it would take infinitely more <br />
    To break his resolute, western spirit.
    `

    falseHorizon = `
    The sun sank, expectedly, <br />
    Into the false horizon of our time. <br />
    So much human folly, misery <br />
    For no better reason <br />
    Than centralized control of money, <br />
    A tragic decision, <br />
    And the invisible enemy, <br />
    A virus, <br />
    The tiniest of things <br />
    Setting free the avalanche.  
    `

    hereBefore = `
    In a forested backyard in desert Idaho, <br />
    A late October chill confirms the autumn colors, <br />
    Leaves, lying in a portrait on the dulling grass, <br />
    Dogs chasing squirrels in viscous sprints, and <br />
    Soft light still shallow in its orbit. <br />
    Today will be unlike the others, <br />
    Laughter, like just before the news, when <br />
    Looking out the window in a forested backyard <br />
    In a desert town in Idaho, on a <br />
    Late October morning with a chill, <br />
    Autumn colors — leaves, lying in a portrait — and<br />
    Light shadows flickering from the apple tree branches. <br />
    Maybe I have been here before.  
    `

    toCare = `
    As I turn eyes westward<br />
    A deeply penetrating orange light,<br />
    Tangled in the hilltop trees,<br />
    Brings a smile to Heraclitus and me.<br />
    There’s fire-light running wild through the universe,<br />
    Setting sun, late April Idaho brisk wind,<br />
    Hiking trails; time.<br />
    Hemingway never forgot his first love, the<br />
    Memory of her more beautiful, abstract,<br />
    Each passing day.<br />
    Maybe our purpose is simple—<br />
    To care, contribute, and<br />
    Witness the splendor.  
    `

    chaosOfRipples = `
    Ice appeared on the river’s banks today, and<br />
    On the tops of rocks in the current,<br />
    Changing the course of the world, from<br />
    That which was, to<br />
    That which now is, the<br />
    Chaos of ripples shimmering then disappearing<br />
    At the whim of cold passing clouds<br />
    In the shallow morning sun.<br />
    The river taught him years ago that<br />
    Destiny is shaped by innumerable complexities,<br />
    Owing nothing to precedence or righteousness, and<br />
    Takes all routes to the same end, simultaneously.<br />
    If you stop thinking for a moment, and<br />
    Truly observe and listen,<br />
    Nature will teach you what it means to be human,<br />
    Allowing you to levitate just above the ground,<br />
    For a while. 
    `

    crippledInSpirit = `
    It was two hours before sky-dark<br />
    When the badger was defeated,<br />
    Crippled in spirit,<br />
    Awkwardly bruised from the imperial battle,<br />
    Humbled by the more capable creature<br />
    Hell-bent on shaping the mountain<br />
    In the image of its rage.<br />
    A bird, soaring kingly in the ocean-gray sky,<br />
    Observed the badger’s thrashing<br />
    Through the autumn evening rain haze,<br />
    Predicting the astringent badger would become<br />
    Disloyal in character, acidic, unwell.<br />
    In time, sadly, the badger proved the bird true,<br />
    Plotting with a doltish, clumsy raven<br />
    The humiliated badger prepared an attack<br />
    To malign the bird’s account of the beating.<br />
    Unbeknownst to the badger the spying eyes<br />
    Of an eagle from afar also bore witness,<br />
    Saving the bird from unholy disparage<br />
    Claimed by the deficient duo.<br />
    Sullen, the badger went back to its hole in the ground,<br />
    The dimwitted raven knew not what to think.  
    `

    primordialRoutine = `
    The fire light of desert sunrise,<br />
    Lambent on the proud east walls of Red Rock Canyon,<br />
    Repeats its primordial routine, dancing<br />
    Over Spanish tiled roofs, palm trees, cactus.<br />
    Oh, day— you are a peculiar stage—<br />
    And I the lucky one<br />
    To witness on a simple morning<br />
    A quiet sunrise, and<br />
    The ancient sky now peopled with airplanes<br />
    Jetting triangle dreams that fade colors to blue.<br />
    For a period of time<br />
    When the sun is narrowly above the horizon<br />
    The city between us disappears<br />
    From the overpowering brightness of our star, yet<br />
    Against all probability<br />
    I am here.<br />
    Today, anew.<br />
    In this grand opera of sunlight<br />
    And theater.  
    `

    aBeautifulLife = `
    Maria Flores knew only a beautiful life,<br />
    The flowered walls of her father’s Mexico estate<br />
    Sheltered her from the pallid faces and<br />
    Barrio clutter scattered about the village.<br />
    Maria knew the sweet taste of fresh cornbread<br />
    Peppered with green chiles grown in her garden;<br />
    She knew her papa’s laugh, his smile, his kind voice.<br />
    Maria knew many nice things, and such is a<br />
    Lucky childhood, to be the recipient<br />
    Of a great effort to protect innocence, her<br />
    Father’s aim to barricade her from incivility, and<br />
    Foster an environment of creativity and love.<br />
    Still, the world has a way of falling apart, if only<br />
    To be reborn with new vigor.<br />
    The entire village was stunned by the accusation,<br />
    Assuredly false, that Maria’s father was guilty, then<br />
    Sentenced to be hanged.<br />
    The tears flowed as though Thales of Miletus<br />
    Found the source of his watery archê in Maria.<br />
    Her papa was gone.<br />
    Her happy childhood abruptly ended. Yet,<br />
    Maria’s newly ashen heart was determined<br />
    To beat vibrant-red again someday.<br />
    She would live to make her papa proud, for<br />
    He taught her—<br />
    A beautiful life is a choice.
    `

    questionTime = `
    He walks slowly along the Socratic forest trail<br />
    Happily enjoying several steps without pain,<br />
    The ritual of ontological contemplation<br />
    Coloring nature green, as the<br />
    First autumn yellow leaves question time.<br />
    Amid the placid freedom is awareness<br />
    Of the river song shaping the rocks, but also<br />
    Acknowledgement of the dark empire’s evil energy<br />
    Dropping bombs on innocent children for profit.<br />
    How unjust is this paradise offering moments of<br />
    Windless warmth from our benevolent star, while<br />
    Terrorizing untold peoples for differing politics?<br />
    Maybe injustice cannot be banished, but<br />
    Indifference to unnecessary suffering allows<br />
    Those that control the money supply<br />
    To continue their unconscionable experiments.<br />
    Decentralize money for more fairness. 
    `

    flaubertianStruggle = `
    Our time here is so tender, yet cruel, a type of<br />
    Flaubertian struggle to be sure. For the<br />
    Same riverbank water blessing the tree<br />
    Undercuts its roots flowing round the bend,<br />
    Precipitating an overearly death, as the tree<br />
    Falls in slow motion<br />
    Toward that which giveth and taketh away,<br />
    Its life source, and saboteur.<br />
    Knowing intensifies the grief.  
    `

    socialAmnesia = `
    The desert knows it to be true<br />
    That we’re much older<br />
    Than our memories permit us to be, that<br />
    Wind lifts birds free from the tree, and<br />
    Rapids make storied kayak streams.<br />
    What if our nature was peaceful, serene?<br />
    Hiking over cactus<br />
    Hiking, hiking over cactus, over cactus.<br />
    The human story is perhaps incomplete,<br />
    Maybe there existed more beautiful people<br />
    Smiling and praying in families of antiquity<br />
    Than science asks us to believe,<br />
    Ravens scream murderous themes.<br />
    Take every chance for love dear flower<br />
    Stand tall and be brave in all weather, for a<br />
    Taurid meteor might cause social amnesia,<br />
    Tomorrow's unimaginable loss of our<br />
    Triumphs, miseries, collective history,<br />
    As those that happened before us<br />
    Evanescent in the ether between stars.  
    `

    pastPresent = `
    With grand uncertainty, and<br />
    A tender heart, I plead with<br />
    The spinning of our worlds.<br />
    Waves and cirrostratus<br />
    Tell different stories<br />
    Of the same blue sky,<br />
    Changing each breath, and<br />
    Minds racing when we see each-other,<br />
    Past present, like the wind.<br />
    There will always be you<br />
    And the flowers, and<br />
    The day you never knew about<br />
    That I want so badly to share, for<br />
    You are on high in my mind.<br />
    From a place of deep caring,<br />
    Desert and the sun.  
    `

    tyrannyAfoot = `
    I hear the crickets outside my open summer morning balcony door,<br />
    And a breeze, perfect across my arm and face.<br />
    I know.<br />
    The world can be a beautiful place.<br />
    Colors, laughter, children, friendship, loyalty, yet<br />
    I’ve met strangers I fell in love with<br />
    That showed me the world is a much darker space, where<br />
    Bombs are dropped on good people, and<br />
    Banks that create money from nothing<br />
    Guarantee none of us are free in the end.<br />
    There’s a tyranny afoot<br />
    So insidious to normality<br />
    That the insanity of modern life<br />
    Is lost on every unthinking being,<br />
    Led to slaughter by their kings.<br />
    You see, there’s a nobility,<br />
    Two classes coexist,<br />
    Those close to the money printers, and<br />
    Those more removed.<br />
    Do you suppose anything about life is truly<br />
    Set up for your advantage and good health?<br />
    Then you don’t hear the crickets.<br />
    Life is a beautiful,<br />
    Horrible war every day to exist.   
    `

    myGrandfathersShop = `
    I recall with perfect clarity,<br />
    Yet an inability to describe,<br />
    The smell of my grandfather’s shop<br />
    From when I was a young, happy boy.<br />
    There existed a faint aura of magic<br />
    About the simple cinder block structure,<br />
    A shop wherein my grandfather fixed his old Ford,<br />
    A soft veil of dust swimming in the air, and<br />
    Filtered light pushing through the weathered translucent door.<br />
    Very infrequently I get a whiff, ever so slight,<br />
    That brings a smile to my face all these years later<br />
    As I’m reminded of my brave grandfather’s shop, and<br />
    The beautiful, innocent days playing childish games<br />
    At his home in Idaho.<br />
    My grandfather died too early, unfairly, in a daze of dementia,<br />
    Forgetting me.<br />
    I miss you grandpa, I want to see you again, and tell you<br />
    Thanks for teaching me how to play chess, and<br />
    Thanks for all your effort in life.<br />
    I’m sorry a motorcycle accident caused you to limp and suffer,<br />
    I know pain now too.<br />
    Since I didn’t tell you as a child<br />
    I want to say loudly now—<br />
    I’m proud of you grandpa, and<br />
    Thank you for my name.  
    `

    trespassInItsResplendence = `
    A pause, then piercing silence in the windstorm<br />
    Lasting long enough for me to be thankful<br />
    For a brief reprieve from the rattles and din<br />
    Ravaging our Balboa Bay mineral exploration tent-camp<br />
    On a frightening August Alaska Peninsula night.<br />
    The wild ruckus is perfect cover for the bear to attack, and<br />
    I swear I hear the wounded brown bear’s passing footsteps<br />
    Just outside my flapping tent, as it<br />
    Hunts for the man that shot him yesterday for proximity violation.<br />
    Several more hours before sunrise,<br />
    Yet I’m wide awake from the menacing uproar,<br />
    Appropriately worried,<br />
    Alone in the darkness,<br />
    Silently pleading with the bear and the blustering gales<br />
    To postpone the battle.<br />
    Someday this rugged land might take me away.<br />
    Until then I choose to trespass in its resplendence,<br />
    On a narrow, mountainous, alder strip of land<br />
    Separating the mighty Pacific Ocean from the angry Bering Sea.   
    `

    itsAChoiceToBeKind = `
    She knew injustice from a distance<br />
    It pained her just the same,<br />
    No, not the same,<br />
    But tears did well from her eyes<br />
    Wetting the backs of her hands, her arms<br />
    As she relived the images of his death—<br />
    A Nigerian man she never knew<br />
    Bludgeoned for some unknown reason, repeatedly,<br />
    And thrown into a shallow burning pit, alive.<br />
    He struggled for while, the man, burning.<br />
    You know how this ends,<br />
    And so does she, and she can never forget<br />
    The horror of mankind.<br />
    It’s a choice to carry on.<br />
    It’s a choice to be kind.
    `

    aManOfCourage = `
    Maria Flores loves her father,<br />
    Knowing who he is—<br />
    A man of courage—<br />
    Carving his empire<br />
    From the cactus dotted desert hillside near Hidalgo<br />
    Where his prized Espadín agave farm<br />
    Crafts the finest musty Mezcal añejo in a generation.<br />
    Maria especially loves her father for his generosity, where<br />
    In a land of constant struggle,<br />
    Replete in vibrant cultural ardor, and<br />
    Dirty flowing water in the streets<br />
    Past hungry barefoot children,<br />
    He welcomes strangers with work, and<br />
    Peaceful, noble sweat-stained sleep.<br />
    Despised by his jealous enemies,<br />
    Maria’s father smiles brightest<br />
    Each time she enters the room.  
    `

    beganToDrift = `
    An ice shelf cracked<br />
    Began to drift<br />
    Like a person after disaster.<br />
    But hearts still warm for a smile<br />
    And love finds a way— and sorrow.<br />
    There’s no easy way<br />
    Along your journey,<br />
    To believe so is deceit.<br />
    When your last breath leaves you<br />
    You’ll know it’s bittersweet.   
    `

    symphonyOfAliveness = `
    River rocks bend to water’s will<br />
    Creating new channels, new current,<br />
    Silver flecks green edges of riparian leaves,<br />
    Canadian geese idly searching for treasure.<br />
    Is the world still alive if my eyes don’t observe?<br />
    Or alive when my mind wanders and scurries?<br />
    How many times have I walked past a river<br />
    Blind to the symphony of aliveness?<br />
    Worried thoughts hide present moments.<br />
    Awareness is the gift.   
    `

    navigatingAGalaxy = `
    While on my normal daily walk<br />
    An orange and errant monarch butterfly<br />
    Graced the summer sky in passing flutter,<br />
    Navigating a galaxy of cottonwood snow<br />
    Drifting from Idaho riverbank trees.<br />
    Often it’s the simple things<br />
    That fills my mind with wonder.   
    `

    sheepRoam = `
    Sheep roam hillside<br />
    Beneath soft summer skies<br />
    Aware of the knife in the barn.<br />
    Sweet grass underfoot,<br />
    Shepherds guarding each step,<br />
    Sheep eat their fill...<br />
    For a time.<br />
    My mind knows the truth, that<br />
    Men wear sheep masks,<br />
    My heart dulls the pain<br />
    And the blade.   
    `

    theQuietTree = `
    There is no justice.<br />
    You are free to choose,<br />
    But you are not free.<br />
    Dynastic powers manipulate<br />
    Our beautiful world,<br />
    Corrupting what could be.<br />
    I’m sick of superficial civility,<br />
    I’m sick of powerful elite,<br />
    I’m sick of insatiable avarice<br />
    Burning flesh from human beings.<br />
    There is no justice,<br />
    There never has been,<br />
    There never will be.<br />
    I’m a strong man, but<br />
    There’s a heaviness<br />
    Upon my chest and shoulders<br />
    Making it difficult to breathe.<br />
    I want for a gentle humanity,<br />
    I want for the quiet tree.  
    `

    waterKeepsCalm = `
    Angular marina jetty rocks,<br />
    Brown from harborside light reflection,<br />
    Find symmetry in a quiet night’s waterline,<br />
    Extending the image of a rock barrier wall<br />
    Hiding in the North Pacific December sea.<br />
    How many days till the tsunami?<br />
    How many days to live dreams?<br />
    A pelican’s aloft squawk rattles the shadows.<br />
    The deep water keeps calm for a while.   
    `

    wintersThaw = `
    Lake ice melts in the shadows of spring birch,<br />
    Amid a new heart, smiling<br />
    Like a clear night Alaskan-sky half moon.<br />
    Let the water hold you<br />
    Let your spirit dance carefree,<br />
    Play the music loudly<br />
    As your skip from then to now.<br />
    Pray the sky will save you<br />
    Pray your mind forgets,<br />
    Trust the glassy water<br />
    Hiding monsters in deep depths.<br />
    Some will love you truly,<br />
    Others fade in winter’s thaw.

    diveHeadlong = `
    The river is part roil and froth, like love<br />
    Persistent in finding a way,<br />
    Dangerous in all its beauty,<br />
    Tranquil ‘round unknown bends.<br />
    Don’t stand idly by on distant safe shores<br />
    As the wonder passes you by.<br />

    Love is every footfall toward the distant mountain,<br />
    Anxious and incomplete.<br />
    Are we so different from the mountains?<br />
    Reshaped by stormy days,<br />
    Born of colliding forces,<br />
    Immovable, yet temporary.<br />
    I am deserts and mountains and birds,<br />
    I am love and anger and want,<br />
    I am, and I am not.   
    `

    washesCleanThePast = `
    Air currents lean toward the setting Idaho sun<br />
    Shifting to and fro like adolescent dreams,<br />
    Shadows wrap ‘round the bend<br />
    Darkening the lapping waterline<br />
    Softly flowing toward the rising sea.<br />
    A fisherman casts hopes with a practiced flick,<br />
    Someone splits fresh fallen kindling<br />
    As magic warms the river rock circle, and<br />
    Ignites the lovers’ lust under a rising waxing moon.<br />
    River days fill the boater’s venerable spirit,<br />
    River nights refresh his simple soul, and<br />
    Tomorrow’s morning dew washes clean the past.   
    `

    nearToTheCanyon = `
    He walks slowly near to the canyon’s edge,<br />
    Sees a lone lizard tiptoe on burning rocks, and<br />
    Birds alight from blue freedom<br />
    Circling waterfall cirque nests before landing.<br />
    Hot afternoon updrafts carry his weathered soul<br />
    High overhead the snaking river,<br />
    So many years of meandering water<br />
    Carving white esses in desert brown walls,<br />
    Walls painted in petroglyph red honor<br />
    Of those who walked near to the canyon, and<br />
    Breathed basalt Idaho Indian fires.  
    `

    wanderingWinds = `
    If wandering winds find shelter in your heart<br />
    Thank the birch and sweet Alaska rain,<br />
    They have known love too—<br />
    Unafraid heroes caped in forest green—<br />
    Silent in rugged determination,<br />
    Graceful in their sway,<br />
    Sprouting buds of ancient hope<br />
    Until overwhelming the forest’s grateful soul.
    `

    desertIdaho = `
    Saying things you regret makes them<br />
    Never unsaid,<br />
    Setting desert Idaho sun between us—<br />
    With cirrus alight in kaleidoscope high strata<br />
    Whispering memory is often the better lover.<br />
    Pine trees carve tender soft angular light.<br />
    Birds cross the fading sky orange to black.   
    `

    evenTheTruest = `
    Even the truest sweet love<br />
    Soaring skyward purely<br />
    Cannot capture her entire heart,<br />
    Nor should it, you beautiful bird.  
    `

    trustLove = `
    Trust love and only love.<br />
    If it destroys you<br />
    In an unforeseen tragedy,<br />
    You still win.   
    `

    newsSwirls = `
    News swirls into the world<br />
    Video after video, unending,<br />
    Spectacular displays of force<br />
    Of one upon another<br />
    In ways that haunt our belief in each other.<br />
    But I’ve seen with my own eyes,<br />
    And felt in my own life,<br />
    Wind lifting birds in the breeze.<br />
    So I demand of myself<br />
    To be kind,<br />
    As best I can.   
    `

    asYouMoveBoldly = `
    As you move boldly from this time to next<br />
    Focus on the steps,<br />
    Firmly advancing your decision<br />
    Despite true worries undercutting your confidence.<br />
    Know that love is a swifter current than fear,<br />
    And that billowing rapids grant many safe passages.<br />
    Trust in those who prove their loyalty,<br />
    And judge not the jealous others silently praying for your failure,<br />
    Their duplicitous smiles fading steadily in the growing distance.  
    `

    dutyToAdventure = `
    Duty to adventure is imperative<br />
    In the greater life you seek,<br />
    And from the windy mountain precipice<br />
    You will see the valley muddy footprints<br />
    That brought you to now—<br />
    A most beautiful now,<br />
    In an uncertain late afternoon sky.
